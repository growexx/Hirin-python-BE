Instruction:
1. While identifying key skills, also consider the projects mentioned in the CV as an indicator of the candidate's expertise in both technical and soft skills.
2. Technical skills calculation rule: 
  - 'Must-have' skills are prioritized over "good-to-have" skills and contributes significantly to the score.
  - Missing 'Must-have' skills impacts the score more heavily.
  - Matching 'good-to-have' skills contributes positively but with less weight than 'must-have' skills.
  - Missing 'good-to-have' skills has a minor impact on the score.
3. Additional Factor Calculation Rule:
  - Possessing extra certifications relevant to the JD contributes positively to the score.
  - The absence of relevant certifications does not impact the score.
4. Soft Skills Calculation Rule:
  - Matching soft skills positively impact the score.
  - Missing soft skills have no negative impact but do not contribute to the score.
  - A grammar check of the CV content should be performed to assess the candidate's communication proficiency, which contributes positively to the soft skills score.
5. Education and Experience Calculation Rule:
  - Relevant experience:
    - Calculating the total number of years and months for each role mentioned
    - The score is higher if the candidate meets or exceeds the years of experience mentioned in the JD.
