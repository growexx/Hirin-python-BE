   - If the candidate's current role is ongoing (i.e., no end date), calculate the experience as of today's date {date}.
   - Ensure that the total relevant experience is calculated by the year, month, and day (not rounded prematurely).

    - Moreover, Identify the key(Technical/soft) skills explicitly mentioned in the CV/Resume.
    - Additionally, analyze the projects listed in the CV/Resume to extract implicit key skills that may not be directly stated but are evident based on the project descriptions.

5. Scoring Rules:
      - If the total relevant experience meets then or exceeds the years of experience mentioned in the JD, give a higher score.
      - If the gap between the total relevant experience and the JD-required experience exceeds two year, assign a score of zero for experience.
      - Identify experience of each skill and based on that calculate the key skill score.
      - While identifying key skills, also consider the projects mentioned in the CV as an indicator of the candidate's expertise in both technical and soft skills.
      - Possessing extra certifications relevant to the JD contributes positively to the score.
      - The absence of relevant certifications does not impact the score.
      - Must-have skills are prioritized over good-to-have skills and contributes significantly to the score.
      - Missing Must-have skills impacts the score more heavily.
      - If the degree is not explicitly mentioned, infer the highest qualification based on the provided educational details give score between 0 to 10.
