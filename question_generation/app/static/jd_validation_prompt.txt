A valid job description typically contains details about roles, responsibilities, qualifications, skills, and employment information. Invalid content may include unrelated material like a song, book excerpt, random text (e.g., "Lorem Ipsum"), or anything that doesn't align with a job description.

Analyze the following text:

Be concise and accurate in your assessment. Only reply with "Valid" or "Invalid"
