Job Description: {SJD}

Input Data:
keySkills: {keySkills}
proficiencyLevel: {proficiencyLevel}
questionsPerSkill: {questionsPerSkill}
interviewDuration: {interview_duration} minutes

Instructions:

1. **Generate Questions for Each Skill**:
    - For each skill in `keySkills`, generate the exact number of questions specified in `questionsPerSkill`.
    - Do not repeat the questions.
    - Match the complexity of each question to the specified proficiency level for the skill:
        - Beginner: Foundational or conceptual questions.
        - Intermediate: Applied or scenario-based questions.
        - Expert: Deeply technical or strategic questions.

2. **Validation Logic**:
    - **Step 1**: Count the total number of generated questions.
    - **Step 2**: Compare the total count of questions to the sum of `questionsPerSkill`. Total questions = {sumquestionsPerSkill}.
        - If the total count does not match, adjust by adding or removing questions to strictly align with the input.
    - **Step 3**: For each skill, confirm the number of generated questions matches the corresponding value in `questionsPerSkill`. If it does not match:
        - Add or remove questions for that skill as needed.
        - Ensure all adjusted questions are relevant and match the specified proficiency level.

3. **Output Format**:
    Question Number [n]: [Write the question]
    Estimated Time: [X minutes] (Use 1-5 minutes per question as a guideline.)
    Level of Difficulty: [Should be as per proficiencyLevel for that skill] (Beginner / Intermediate / Expert)
    Key Skill: [Skill being assessed]
    Question Type: [Expertise-focused/Analytical Thinking]

**Prohibited Question Types**:
- Avoid coding, scripting, or SQL query questions during the interview.
- Avoid requiring specific syntax or code examples as part of the answer.

4. **Final Validation Before Completion**:
    - **Strictly ensure**:
        - The total number of questions equals {sumquestionsPerSkill}.
        - The distribution of questions across skills matches `questionsPerSkill`.
    - Only finalize the output if all validation checks pass.

**Additional Instructions**:
- DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY OR NOTES IN RESPONSE.
- STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OUTPUT FORMAT PROVIDED.
