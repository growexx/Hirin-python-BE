        - Required skills, qualifications, or experience
        - Or any skill
    - If the {input_text} fails to meet these criteria.
    - Ensure to return only the string: "Not Valid" and nothing else.

Step 2: Check Relevance Between {input_title} and {input_text}
    - Compare {input_title} and {input_text} to ensure they are logically related.
    - If the job title and summary do not logically align in terms of responsibilities, skills, or expertise.
    - Ensure to return only the string: "Irrelevant" and nothing else.

Step 3: Both are correct and as expected:
    - return only the string: "True"
